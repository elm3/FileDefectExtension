# ButtonAdd

This is a Chrome extension to add a button to the bottom of a `os.mbed.com/questions/*` page.  The button will create an issue in the IOTDEV project in Jira.

#### Current Status
1. It does not actually do anything with the data.  It just fills out a form and then nothing.  It needs the JIRA connection.


#### Todo
1. Segment out the work for os.mbed.com so that we can use a similar technique for zendesk.
